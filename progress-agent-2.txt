## Codebase Patterns

- **4-layer pattern**: All features follow the same structure:
  1. Canvas API types in `src/types/canvas.ts`
  2. API client in `src/api/` (calls Canvas REST endpoints)
  3. Service layer in `src/services/` (business logic shared by CLI and MCP)
  4. CLI command in `src/commands/` + MCP tool in `src/mcp/tools/`

- **CLI/MCP Parity**: Every CLI command MUST have a corresponding MCP tool with the same functionality. Update CLAUDE.md parity table when adding features.

- **Service pattern**: Services accept options interfaces and return typed results. CLI and MCP both call the same service function to ensure identical behavior.

- **Date filtering**: Use ISO strings for date ranges. Most tools look back N days (announcements) or forward N days (calendar, upcoming).

- **Course filtering**: When fetching across all courses, use `listCoursesWithGrades()` to get active courses, then use `Promise.all()` to parallelize requests.

- What was implemented: Calendar Events feature - shows non-assignment calendar events (office hours, review sessions, school events, field trips)
- Files changed:
  - `src/types/canvas.ts`: Added CalendarEvent type with fields id, title, description, start_at, end_at, location_name, location_address, context_code, html_url, workflow_state
  - `src/api/calendar.ts`: Created API client for GET /api/v1/calendar_events with type=event filter
  - `src/services/types.ts`: Added CalendarEventItem service type
  - `src/services/calendar.ts`: Created service that fetches calendar events for courses, filters to active events, truncates descriptions to 200 chars
  - `src/services/index.ts`: Exported calendar service
  - `src/commands/calendar.ts`: Created CLI command with --course-id, --days, --format, --student options
  - `main.ts`: Registered calendar command
  - `src/mcp/tools/get-calendar-events.ts`: Created MCP tool with student_id, days, course_id parameters
  - `src/mcp/tools/index.ts`: Registered get_calendar_events tool
  - `CLAUDE.md`: Updated parity table, CLI usage examples, MCP tools table, architecture diagram, and key endpoints table

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered: Use `type=event` parameter to filter calendar events vs assignments
  - Pattern discovered: All services that work across courses should build context_codes array (`course_${id}`) and create a courseNameMap for display
  - Pattern discovered: Filter by workflow_state to exclude deleted/inactive items
  - Gotcha: Description truncation is done in the service layer (not API or view layer)
  - Gotcha: When using formatDate in CLI commands, import both `formatDate` and `output` from utils/output.ts
  - Context: CLAUDE.md has multiple sections that need updating: parity table (line 19-34), CLI usage (line 73-148), MCP tools table (line 155-170), architecture (line 177-210), and key endpoints (line 238-248)

- What was implemented: Discussion Topics feature - shows discussion topics with participation status
- Files changed:
  - `src/types/canvas.ts`: Added DiscussionTopic type with id, title, message, posted_at, last_reply_at, discussion_type, discussion_subentry_count, unread_count, assignment_id, require_initial_post, html_url, context_code, user_name, read_state
  - `src/api/discussions.ts`: Created API client for GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/discussion_topics with order_by=recent_activity
  - `src/services/types.ts`: Added DiscussionItem service type
  - `src/services/discussions.ts`: Created service that fetches discussion topics for courses, filters to active topics, ordered by most recent activity
  - `src/services/index.ts`: Exported discussions service
  - `src/commands/discussions.ts`: Created CLI command with --course-id, --days, --format, --student options
  - `main.ts`: Registered discussions command
  - `src/mcp/tools/get-discussions.ts`: Created MCP tool with student_id, days, course_id parameters
  - `src/mcp/tools/index.ts`: Registered get_discussions tool
  - `CLAUDE.md`: Updated parity table, CLI usage examples, MCP tools table, architecture diagram, and key endpoints table

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered: Discussion topics use order_by=recent_activity to sort by most recent posts/replies
  - Pattern discovered: Check both posted_at and last_reply_at when filtering by date - use the more recent one
  - Gotcha: When working in parallel with other agents, conflicts are common. Always pull with --rebase before pushing
  - Gotcha: 3-strike push rule - after 3 failed push attempts, document the blocker and wait rather than spinning
  - Context: Agent-1 was working on US-017 (Feedback) and US-019 (People) in parallel, causing merge conflicts
  - Context: Conflict resolution: always keep BOTH features when merging parallel work - don't delete either agent's contribution

## Blockers
- After 3 attempts to push (all resulting in conflicts with agent-1's concurrent work on US-017 and US-019), documenting per 3-strike rule
- Implementation is complete and committed locally at 581eaa8
- Will retry push after brief wait
